This directory contains Highly Experimental Code
It is Highly advised not to use this code.  

1.  It may go away
2.  File names will change
3.  Type names will change
4.  Dependencies and Structure of Code will change

Your completely nuts if you depend on this code in production.

It's in SVN for a big reason. Parts of one experient merge with parts of another
experiement.   Keeping it in SVN allows for a history to be created.   

When something stablizes and I am getting ready to share, I will move it out of the Experiments branch.

Code in Experiments directory should be considered under the GPL license.   That hopefully will prevent you from using it in production.   When it's ready I will move it to MIT or MPL.

Thanks
